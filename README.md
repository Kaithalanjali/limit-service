This is a microservice which is having dependency config-client ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6547ef81-4441-44af-9a10-ca0b43ff3861)


Please refer application.properties file, how I am making config imports

Note: configuraton on config-server has more priority than the local configurations present in application.properties
